By examining key factors such as investment avenues, gender-based differences, age distribution, investment objectives, and monitoring frequency, this project provides insights that can be utilized for strategic planning, financial advisory, and policy-making. The data analyzed includes various investment types such as Mutual Funds, Equities, Fixed Deposits, Gold, and Public Provident Funds (PPF). The goal is to uncover the underlying trends and patterns that drive investment decisions and to help financial institutions, advisors, and policymakers understand their target demographics better.
